# üëã Welcome to Orbyss.io

**Orbyss** provides a platform and .NET components that help developers build native apps faster and more efficiently.  
We focus on reducing boilerplate code, reducing strongly typed code, empowering configuration-based implementations, and enabling rapid UI development with JSON-powered dynamic components.

Our NuGet packages are a mix of production-grade libraries used in the Orbyss platform and open source components we believe can thrive with community input.

## üì¶ Featured Repositories

### üßæ <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.KckXqAg1RkJOIfiK0cJqfwHaHa?pid=Api" width="24" /> [Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms](https://github.com/Orbyss-io/Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms)
![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms)
![NuGet Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms)

A fully .NET-native implementation of the [JsonForms.io](https://jsonforms.io) standard for schema-driven forms in Blazor.

This core library handles form generation using **JSON Schema**, **UI Schema**, and **translation schema**, while staying UI-framework agnostic.

To use it with any component library, implement a custom ComponentInstanceProvider. We developed implementations for [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com) and [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/), but you can plug in your own. No Angular or Web Components required.
