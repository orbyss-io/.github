# 👋 Welcome to Orbyss.io

**Orbyss** provides a platform and .NET components that help developers build native apps faster and more efficiently.  
We focus on reducing boilerplate code, reducing strongly typed code, empowering configuration-based implementations, and enabling rapid UI development with JSON-powered dynamic components.

Our NuGet packages are a mix of production-grade libraries used in the Orbyss platform and open source components we believe can thrive with community input.

## 📦 Featured Repositories

### 🧾 <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.KckXqAg1RkJOIfiK0cJqfwHaHa?pid=Api" width="24" /> [Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms](https://github.com/Orbyss-io/Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms)
![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms)
![NuGet Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms)

A fully UI-framework agnostic .NET-native implementation of the [JsonForms.io](https://jsonforms.io) standard for schema-driven forms in Blazor. No Angular or Web Components required.

The package is meant to support all functionality that is also natively supported by jsonforms.io. If any function is missing or malfunctioning, please let us know and we will fix it right away: either [open an issue](https://github.com/orbyss-io/Orbyss.Blazor.JsonForms/issues), or fork the repo and create a PR.  
This is an open source project. **Together we can make it better, faster.**

We developed UI implementations for [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com) and [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/), but you can plug in your own by implementing 'IComponentInstanceProvider'.

> **Important Note:** This project is an independent Blazor-based implementation and is **not** affiliated with or supported by the [jsonforms.io](https://jsonforms.io/) team. Please direct all support requests for this package to the Orbyss.io team, not jsonforms.io.

### 🧮 <img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.Dj2CTZvhjHHg3iTNsKGdHwHaHa?r=0&pid=Api" width="24" />  [Orbyss.Components.Syncfusion.JsonDataGrid](https://github.com/Orbyss-io/Orbyss.Components.Syncfusion.JsonDataGrid)
Use the powerful [SfGrid](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/datagrid/getting-started) without writing strongly typed C# classes.  
Data binding and UI behavior such as filters plus columns headers are entirely Schema-driven — perfect for dynamic or configuration-based UIs.
