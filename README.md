# 👋 Welcome to Orbyss.io

**Orbyss** provides a platform and .NET components that help developers build native apps faster and more efficiently.  
We focus on reducing boilerplate, eliminating unnecessary strongly typed code, and enabling rapid UI development with JSON-powered components.

Our NuGet packages are a mix of production-grade libraries used in the Orbyss platform and open source components we believe can thrive with community input.

## 📦 Featured Repositories

### 🔧 [Orbyss.Components.JsonForms](https://github.com/Orbyss-io/Orbyss.Components.JsonForms)
The core library that wraps the [JsonForms.io](https://jsonforms.io) standard to generate forms in Blazor using **JSON Schema**, **UI Schema**, and **translation schema**.  
Built to be UI-framework agnostic, it requires a custom `ComponentInstanceProvider` for integration with specific Blazor libraries.

---

### 🎨 [Orbyss.Components.MudBlazor.JsonForms](https://github.com/Orbyss-io/Orbyss.Components.MudBlazor.JsonForms)
An extension of `Orbyss.Components.JsonForms` for [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com).  
Renders JSON-based forms using `MudTextField`, `MudDatePicker`, and other MudBlazor components via a MudBlazor-specific `ComponentInstanceProvider`.

---

### 📊 [Orbyss.Components.Syncfusion.JsonForms](https://github.com/Orbyss-io/Orbyss.Components.Syncfusion.JsonForms)
A Syncfusion-powered extension of `Orbyss.Components.JsonForms`.  
Renders forms using Syncfusion Blazor components like `SfTextBox`, `SfDatePicker`, etc., with full support for schema-driven UI generation.

---

### 🧮 [Orbyss.Components.Syncfusion.JsonDataGrid](https://github.com/Orbyss-io/Orbyss.Components.Syncfusion.JsonDataGrid)
Use the powerful `SfDataGrid` without writing strongly typed C# classes.  
Data binding, UI behavior, and validation are entirely JSON Schema-driven — perfect for dynamic or configuration-based UIs.
